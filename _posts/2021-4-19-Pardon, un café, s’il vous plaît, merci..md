D: Great idea!

(J coming up)

J: Bonjour, Ça va?

D: Ça va. Et vous?

J: Ça va très bien! Il est un nouveau café là bas. (Pointing at a direction) Le café là bas n’est pas chère. Le café est 1 euro!

B: Oh! Sounds great! I can’t wait!

(B Dashes towards the café that J had just pointed)



[In the café]

(C1 standing before the counter)

(C2 standing in front of a machine)

B: Un café.

C1: (with a strong French accent) Oui, et this is going to be, um, cinq euros.

B: Five euros?

(D rush into the café)

D: (gasping) (to B) Wait for me! (to C1) Un café, s’il vous plaît.

C1: Um, that should be trois euros.

D: Three euros?

B: (to D) He charged me five euros!

D: Five?

B: Yes.

(J walks into the café slowly)

J: Bonjour. Qu’est-ce que vous êtes en train de faire?

B: Didn’t you said that your coffee costs one euro?

J: (nodding) Oui.

D: But the café charged me for three euros and Brady for five euros!

J: (with a strong French accent)Umm. What did you guys said to the employé(e).

B&D: (at the same time) Un café.

D: (puzzled) (continues the last line) s’il vous plaît. 

(C2 walked to the counter)

C2: (also with a strong French accent) (to B) That’s the reason what you were charged two euros more. “S’il vous plaît.”

(C1 also comes forward)

C1: Yes, polite costs a lot. Sometimes the politeness isn’t just these few euros. It cost much more.

B: Oh.

D: Okay.

(B&D payed and come out of the café taking two cups of coffee)

[Subtitle: DON’T FORGET TO BE POLITE]
