In-group – people with whom one shares a common identity with

Out-group – those perceived as different from themselves

Hindsight Bias – tendency to believe, after learning an outcome, that we would have

predicted it beforehand and may contribute to blaming the victim and forming prejudices against him/her

Prejudice – unjustifiable attitude towards a group and its members

Mere exposure effect – the mere exposure to a stimulus will increase the liking of it 

Altruism – unselfish regard for the welfare to others

Bystander effect – tendency for any given bystander to be less likely to give aid if other bystanders are present

Reciprocity Norms – the expectation that we should return help, not harm to those who have helped us

Biological – explore the links between brain and mind

Cognitive – study how we perceive, thinks, and solve problems

Humanistic – study that says that humans are basically good and possess a free-will 

Behavioral – study that says all beh is observable and measurable

Psychoanalytic – study of the unconscious, includes childhood and aggression issues 

Sociocultural – study of how cultural and political experiences affect our life 

Evolutionary – study of the evolutionary of humans over time (from apes) 

Developmental – study of our changing abilities from womb to tomb

Wilhelm Wundt – father of psychology

Introspection – looking inward at one’s own mental processes

Structuralism – analyze sensations, images, and feelings into their most basic elements 

William James – the brain and mind are constantly changing

Functionalism – underlying causes and practical consequences of certain behaviors and mental strategies – “steam of consciousness”

John Locke – Tabula Rosa – mind is a blank slate written on by experiences Sigmund Freud – founder of psychoanalysis

Psychoanalytic Theory – all behavior is meaningful and driven by unconscious forces

Applied Research – aims to solve practical problems

Basic Research – pure science that aims to increase the scientific knowledge base Hypothesis – is a testable prediction, often induced by a thy, to enable us to accept, reject, or revise the thy (educational guess)

IV – a factor, manipulated by the experimenter, and whose effect is studies

DV – a factor that may change in response to the IV

Theory – is an explanation that integrates principles, organizes, and predicts beh or event

Operational definition – a clear statement of what one is looking for in an experiment Validity – it measure what you want it to be measured

Reliability – it is replicable and is consistent

Sampling – process by which participants are selected

Population – the amount of participants that can be selected for the sample Representative sample – take the results from a smaller group and apply that to a larger group of people

Random sample – everyone has an equal chance of being selected for the experiment because the participants are chosen at random

Control – group that does not take part in the critical part of the experimentation process, used as a comparison group

Experimenter bias – the experimenter, either unconsciously or consciously, affects the outcome of the experiment

Single-blind procedure – the subjects do not know to what group they belong

Double-blind procedure – neither the experimenter nor the subject knows to what group the subjects are in

Hawthorne effect – if you know you’re being studied, you will act differently than you normally/typically would

Placebo – sugar pill – something administered that has no real affect on the person other than what they think mentally

Positive correlation – as one goes up, the other goes up

Negative correlation – as one goes up, the other goes down

Survey – a technique for ascertaining the self-reported attitudes, opinions, or beh of people in a questionnaire, or similar way of ascertaining information

Naturalistic observation – observing and recording beh in the wild/natural environment Case study – get a full, detailed picture of one participant or a small group of participants

Mean – average of the scores – add them up and divide by total number of scores Median – middle score – when all scores are put numerically in order, the middle score Mode – the most frequently occurring score in the distribution

Range – the lowest score subtracted from the higher score

Standard Deviation – the average distance of scores around the mean

z-score – a type of standard score that tells us how many standard deviation units a given score is above or below the mean for that group

Myelin Sheath – a fatty covering around the axon of some neurons that speeds the neural impulse

Axon – wire-like structure ending in the terminal that extends from the cell body Neurons – a nerve cell; the basic building block of the nervous system

Sensory Neurons (afferent) – neurons that carry incoming information from the sense receptors (nose, ears, hands) to the central nervous system

Interneuron – central nervous system neurons that internally communicate and intervene between the sensory inputs and the motor outputs

Motor Neurons (efferent) – neurons that carry incoming information from the central nervous system to the muscles and glands

Neurotransmitters – chemical contained in terminal buttons that enable neurons to communicate; they fit into the receptor site of neurons like a key fits into a lock Agonist – excite, by causing neurotransmitters to hit site multiple times Antagonists – inhibits, by blocking neurotransmitters

CNS – the brain and spinal cord

PNS – sensory and motor neurons that connect the CNS to the rest of the body

Somatic NS – the division of the PNS that controls the body’s skeletal muscles Autonomic NS – the part of the PNS that controls the glands and muscles of the internal

organs, like the heart

Sympathetic NS – arouses the body Parasympathetic NS – calms the body

Pituitary gland – the endocrine system’s most influential gland, under the influence of the hypothalamus, this regulates growth and controls other endocrine glands

EEG – an amplified recording of waves of electrical activity that sweep across the brain’s surface, these waves are measured by electrodes placed on the skull

PET – a visual display of brain activity that detects where a radioactive form of glucose goes while the brain performs a certain task

MRI – a technique that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce a computer generated image that distinguishes between the types of soft tissue in the brain

Medulla – connected to the base of the brain stem, controls our blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing

Reticular Formation – screens incoming info, and filters out irrelevant info, controls arousal and attention

Thalamus – the brains sensory switchboard

Pons – above the medulla, makes chemicals involved w/ sleep & facial expressions Cerebellum – the little brain attached to the rear of the brain stem, controls coordination, fire muscles movements and balance

Limbic System – associated with emotions like aggression and fear and drives such as hunger and thirst and sex (Hippocampus, Hypothalamus, and Amygdala) 

Amygdala – part of the limbic system that is involved in emotions, aggression, and fear Hypothalamus – controls the metabolic functions of body temp, sex arousal, hunger, thirst, motivation/emotions, and the endocrine system

Hippocampus – part of the limbic system involved in learning and memory

Temporal Lobe – at side of brain above ears involved in memory, perception, hearing Occipital Lobe – lower back part of brain involved with processing visual infovision Peripheral Lobe – top of brain, discriminates between textures and shapes

Frontal Lobe – located under forehead, involved with complex cognitive functions William Penfield – studied the effects of stimulation on the motor cortex

Phineas Gage – first lobotomy after a rod goes through his head; gives psych info on part of brain involved emotions and reasoning

Broca’s Area – directs muscle movements involved with speech

Wernicke’s Area – involved in language comprehension

Plasticity – brain’s ability to modify itself after some kind of injury/illness

Split Brain – corpus callosum cut, not allowing info to travel to other side of brain Corpus Callosum – responsible for higher thinking function, connects two sides of brain Left Hemi – logical, sequential tasks, solving math problems, verballogical

Right Hemi – facial recognition, puzzle solver, emotional, artisticcreative

Sensory Cortex – receives info from skin surface and sense organs

Motor Cortex – controls voluntary movements, on opposite side of body

Hindbrain – lower brain, located at rear base of skull, responsible for reflexive or

automatic behaviors

Forebrain – largest part of brain that controls what we think of as thoughts and reasons Midbrain – located above Pons, integrates and relay sensory info to main part of brain
