Interneuron – central nervous system neurons that internally communicate and intervene between the sensory inputs and the motor outputs

Motor Neurons (efferent) – neurons that carry incoming information from the central nervous system to the muscles and glands

Neurotransmitters – chemical contained in terminal buttons that enable neurons to communicate; they fit into the receptor site of neurons like a key fits into a lock 

Agonist – excite, by causing neurotransmitters to hit site multiple times Antagonists – inhibits, by blocking neurotransmitters

Threshold – the level of stimulation required to trigger a neural impulse

Action Potential – a neural impulse that travels down the axon domino effect 

All-or-none – when the depolarized current exceeds the threshold of a neuron, it will fire unless it’s below, causing is not to fire

Reuptake – neurotransmitters that can’t find an area across the synapse to attach will be reabsorbed by the sending neuron

Acetylcholine – activates motor neurons and skeletal muscles, too little = Alzheimer’s Dopamine – contributes to voluntary movements and pleasurable emotions, lack of it causes Parkinson’s as too much causes schizophrenia

Endorphins – natural pain killers created by brain, promotes pain relief, like morphine

Bulimia – eating a large amount of food and then purging (barf) it up 

Anorexia – not eating food at all (staving)

Obesity – overeating and gaining excessive amount of weight

Drive reduction Theory – physiological need creates an aroused tension states (drive) that motivates an organism to satisfy that need

James-Lange Thy – experience of emotion is our awareness of our physiological response to emotionally arousing stimuli (stimuli then response then emote)
