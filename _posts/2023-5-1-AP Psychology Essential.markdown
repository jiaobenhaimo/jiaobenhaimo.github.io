**Neurotransmitters**

| Neurotransmitter | Functions and Characteristics |
|---|---|
| Acetylcholine (ACh) | Released by motor neurons controlling skeletal muscles. Contributes to the regulation of attention, arousal, and memory. Some ACh receptors stimulated by nicotine. |
| Dopamine (DA) | Contributes to control of voluntary movement, pleasurable emotions. Decreased levels associated with Parkinson's disease. Overactivity at DA synapses associated with schizophrenia. Cocaine and amphetamines elevate activity at DA synapses. |
| Norepinephrine (NE) | Contributes to modulation of mood and arousal. Cocaine and amphetamines elevate activity at NE synapses. |
| Serotonin | Involved in regulation of sleep and wakefulness, eating, aggression. Abnormal levels may contribute to depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Prozac and similar antidepressant drugs affect serotonin circuits. |
| GABA | Serves as widely distributed inhibitory transmitter. Valium and similar antianxiety drugs work at GABA synapses. |
| Endorphins | Resemble opiate drugs in structure and effects. Contribute to pain relief and perhaps to some pleasurable emotions. |

Conditioned/Secondary - Learned (Others)

Negative R/P contrariae sunt. 


### Cognitive Psychology

Reliability - don't change. Validity contrarium est.

**Newborn reflexes**

Rooting Reflex – when touched on the cheek, a baby will turn its head and seek a nipple 

Moro Reflex – when startled, baby flings limbs out and slowly retract them

Babinski Reflex – when a baby’s foot is stroked, he/she will spread their toes

**Erik Erikson**

Trust v Mistrust – birth to one year, infancy – if needs are dependably met, infants develop a sense of basic trust

Autonomy v shame/doubt – age 1 to age 2, toddlerhood – learn to exercise will and do things for themselves, or they doubt their abilities

Industry v inferiority – age 6 to puberty, elementary school – learn the pleasures of applying themselves to tasks, or they fell inferior 

Identity v role confusion – teen years to early 20s, adolescence – work at refining a sense of self by testing roles and then integrating them to form a single identity, or they become confused about who they are 

Intimacy v isolation – 20s to early 40s, young adulthood – struggle to form close relationships and to gain the capacity for intimate love, or they feel isolated 

Generativity v stagnation – 40s to 60s, middle adulthood – people discover a sense of contributing to the world, usually through family and work, or they feel a lack of purpose for their life 

Integrity v despair – late 60s to death, late adulthood – when reflecting on their life, the older adult may feel a sense of satisfaction or failure 



**Jean Piaget**

Sensorimotor – birth to 2 years of age, experience world through senses and actions, learn object permanence and stranger anxiety

Preoperational – 2 to 6 years of age, representing things with words rather than images, use intuitive rather than logical thinking, very egocentric (only see from own view) 

Concrete operational – from ages 7 to 11, think logically about concrete events, grasp concrete analogies and performing arithmetical operations, learn conservation 

Formal operational – from age 12 through adulthood, they begin to think abstractly, they understand abstract logic and potential for mature moral reasoning 



**Kohlberg**

Preconventional – obey in order to avoid punishment or get reward 
- in the case of stealing medicine in order to save the life of your wife, someone with this morality would say ... no, I don’t want to get in trouble 

Conventional – care for others and uphold laws and social rules simply b/c they are laws - ... no, it is illegal to steal and I don’t want to break a law 

Postconventional – affirm people’s agreed-upon rights or follow what one personally perceives as correct or ethically ok 
- ... yes, my wife needs it and a whole life is must more worth the $50 the medicine costs, in truth, I would be doing what anyone would do

Electra complex – same as Oedipus, but with girl’s fear of mother 




Fixation – if a problem occurs in one stage, similar problems may come up later in life, ie. Smoking is an oral fixation, due to a lack of pleasure in oral stage 

Representative Heuristics – judging the likelihood of things in terms of how well they seem to represent/match particular prototype, ie. a short, slim, poetry reading man is a ivy league professor, not a truck drive (don’t think of the many truck drivers compared to the small number of ivy league professors) 

Available Heuristics – estimating the likelihood of events based on their availability in memory, ie. after a horrible house fire, a person will think that a house fire is more common than a tornado hitting house, even if they live in tornado valley, b/c they can still remember they house fire 


Functional Fixedness – the inability to see the different uses of an object, ie. a paper clip’s only use is to clip papers (don’t think about making it into a hook, etc.)

Noam Chomsky – the best time to learn a language is during childhood, kids are sponges and able to absorb the language better than in high school

Benjamin Whorf – linguistic determination – language determines the way we think 

Babbling Stage – the stage of speech development in which an infant utters various sounds at first unrelated to the house hold language

One-word Stage – the stage of speech development during which a child speaks mostly in single words, from age 1 to 2

Pleasure principle – id operated on this – strive for pleasure, at all costsEgo – the largely conscious, executive part of personality that mediates between the demands of the id, superego, and reality

Reality principle – ego operates on this – you can’t always get what you want, realistically 

Superego – the part of the personality that represents internalized ideals and provides standards for judgments and for future aspirations (angel)
