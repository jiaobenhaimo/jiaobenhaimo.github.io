# Octopi! 
Today, I'm going to talk about *octopuses*. 

Well not really. 

It's *octopi* that I'm talking about.

Well. Actually, the ending “-i”. 

Almost every English word have a plural form. We learned the plural form of a lot of words. For the most ordinary ones, add “-s” to the end of the word (e.g.  apple to apples). For the not so ordinary ones, you have to add “-es” (e.g. ax to axes) or change the ending “-y” to “-ies” (e.g. fly to flies) etc.. If you are fond of remembering words (which I bet you defiantly don’t), you may discover some *terribly* complicated *simple rules*. 

A large part of English is rooted from Latin. English terms is hard to remember because much of them are just borrowed from Latin. For example, our favorite, alveoli, which is the plural form of alveolus, is rooted from Latin. These words remained using the Latin ending for plural forms.

There is a few ways to pluralize words from Latin. Words that end in “-us” are pluralized with an “-i” (e.g. alumnus to alumni, alveolus to alveoli, stimulus to stimuli). Many scientific words come from Latin, which has numerous possible endings, such as “-ae” (formula to formulae, antenna to antennae), and more.
