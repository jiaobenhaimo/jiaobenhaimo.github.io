# A Harmonian Solder’s Story

### I. Long Way

Tang Bian had his mind emptied, lying on the seat on the coach, hoping to find a place to hide him self. 

The car run into a lump of dirt, Bian’s head instantly wave his head like a rattle drum and crashed on to the side of the coach. He can no longer bear all these and cried out loudly.

“Mommy! Mei! Now I’m here being a solder not knowing when to return! What if something happened, what will you do!” 

Bian can’t bear all this. Thinking of being on the battlefield, being inches from death and possibly, not homecoming, he wept, not knowing what he will end up with. 

Just while crying, Bian felt somebody push him. Barely opened his eyes filled with tears, he saw a dirty piece of handkerchief in front of him. 

With out thinking twice, he grabbed it and starts rubbing his nose. Dizzily, a sound comes to Bian’s ears.

“How do you do? I thought I heard that you had a full happy family.”

“Yep, dude. But now I end up here and don’t know when will I met my family again, so I’m weeping here.”

“Oh. Well you seems to be really unfortunate. But, from another aspect, we are the ordinary people. We left our hometown and going to the borders with the army. I can’t guarantee what our future will be like, but isn’t this a way to protect our family?”

The speech is reasonable. Bian stoped sobbing and looked toward him. 

Sitting next to him is a young man with the approximately the same age. He seems to be still farming before he left home. His bare arms was filled with scars, wearing a pale white short gown with some dirt on it. Two skinny legs inside baggy black pants, having two straw sandals tattered just like a few piece of grass, like he had just done synchronized swimming in side a muddy puddle. Only his eyes is bright, sparkling.

“Well.” Bian stayed in silence for a few moments, changed his attitude and then ask, “Well, dude, it’s really as what you said. Well, um, can you tell me your name?” 

“Just call me Sirius. What about you?” Sirius turned toward Bian, laughed.”

“Oh, Sirius, nice to meet you! My surname is Tang, my given name is Bian. Well, I think we’ll have to depend on each other later.“ 

“No prob. If you are in danger anytime, I’ll rescue you at once!”
